Recently I've been thinking a lot about what matters for me. As many people I struggle with spending too much time
on the internet. Content consumable in small little pieces like tweets, titles on hackernews or simply images on reddit
let's you feel good temporarily, but as long you don't consume it purposefully, it didn't really give me anything longterm.

End of October I stumbled upon digital well being on Android: It allows you to set a certain time of the night, at which
notifications gets disabled and your screen becomes black and white. This seems to be quite a nice solution in the late
evening, I stopped reading my phone in the late evening, still there are like 16 hours I have my computer/phone reachable
during the time.

This weekend though I had an idea: Let's use black and white _all_ the time. Almost all systems have an offer for that
actually:

### Mac OS X

[OSX settings]: {{ "/assets/images/picture_black_white_osx.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }} "OSX Settings"


### Android

* Enable developer settings:
* Goto about this phone and tab 7 times on the phone status

### KDE

In KDE enable the following desktop effect.

## Experience report
 
Using it for two a couple of months now it seems to have a lot of positive effects:

* Focusing seems much easier, given that applications distract you less. No longer there is a nice red icon on unread notifications. 
* Reading twitter etc. seems just way boring, especially if you don't actually pay attention.
* The world seems much more colourful. After looking at my screen for a while the world seems so interesting. Everything seems
   to have more details than it used to have.
* Finally: You start to care more about accessbility, which well, to be honest is something we really should care more about in
  the techology sector.

I would recommend trying out to set your phone  / computer into black and white / darkmode for a little while at least.
Maybe it makes a difference for you too.
