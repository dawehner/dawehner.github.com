<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about what matters to me. As many people I struggle with spending too much time
on the internet. Content consumable in small little pieces like tweets, titles on hackernews or simply images on reddit
let&rsquo;s you feel good temporarily, but as long you don&rsquo;t consume it purposefully, it didn&rsquo;t really give me anything longterm.</p>

<p>End of October I stumbled upon <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/9137850?hl=en&amp;utm_source=wellbeing.google&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=wellbeing">digital wellbeing</a> on Android: It allows you to set a certain time of the night, at which
notifications gets disabled and your screen becomes black and white. This seems to be quite a nice solution in the late
evening. I stopped reading my phone in the late evening. While this is a solution for the night, there are still like 16 hours I have my computer/phone reachable.</p>

<p>One weekend though I had an idea: Let&rsquo;s use black and white <strong>all</strong> the time. Almost all systems have a feature for this already:</p>

<h2 id="setting-it-up">Setting it up</h2>

<h3 id="mac-os-x">Mac OS X</h3>

<ul>
<li>Open the settings applications</li>
<li>Search for accessibility in settings</li>
<li>Find the display category</li>
<li>Choose &ldquo;use greyscale&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="android">Android</h3>

<ul>
<li>Enable developer settings: Goto about this phone and tab 7 times on the phone status</li>
<li>Go to Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Developer options -&gt; &ldquo;Simulate colour space&rdquo;</li>
<li>Choose &ldquo;Monochromazy&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ios">IOS</h3>

<p>There seems to be <a href="https://www.macobserver.com/tips/how-to/grayscale-apple-devices/">ways</a> to enable greyscale rendering.</p>

<h3 id="linux">Linux</h3>

<p>On Linux you can change the configuration following <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/443335/how-can-ubuntu-be-made-grayscale">this post</a>.</p>

<h2 id="experience-report">Experience report</h2>

<p>Using it for more than a month now it seems to have a lot of positive effects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Focusing seems much easier: There is overall less visual noise. For example red unread notification icons aren&rsquo;t prominent anymore at all.</li>
<li>Reading twitter etc. seems to simply be boring. I observed that I no longer just scroll through endless lists.</li>
<li>The world outside seems much more colourful: It seems to be that their are more details.</li>
<li>For computers I&rsquo;m just using it in my freetime now. Greyscale seems to be too boring.</li>
<li>Finally: You start to care more about accessbility, which well, to be honest is something we really should think about anyway in the techology sector.</li>
</ul>

<p>Give it a try. Maybe it makes a difference to you as well.</p>
